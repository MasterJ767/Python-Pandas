Reflective Report
=================

Summary
-------

The python code which I have adapted based on the tutorial I was given and then the various tutorials on the
https://www.panda3d.org/manual/ website generates the standard Panda3d scenery base with a red hue.
Then it renders 10 pandas of varying sizes and colours and sets them up to walk on predefined motions paths.
Using functions I have made it possible to vary the walk speed, turn speed, colour and starting x co-ordinate for 9 of
the pandas and for the tenth panda it is possible to do all of this as well as manipulate the starting y co-ordinate
and the ending x and y co-ordinates. This tenth panda also takes a circular route around the map unlike the other 9 who
continue to move in a singular plane. Finally I added a royalty free mp3 file to play in the background to add another 
dimension ot this creation.

I initially found it very difficult to get started on this project as I had trouble installing Panda3d and ensuring
that I was using the correct version of Python (version 3.7). Once I got past this setback I found the Panda3d tool was 
relatively straightforward to use. A few errors occurred when I attempted to add my own things to the code such as 
varying the volume of the sound randomly and I could not work out how to add more colours to the project with panda3d 
than red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, black and white. I intend to still implement some of these features;
however I am yet to overcome these challenges.

Past use of tools
-----------------

I am fairly familiar with Python. I was first introduced to it in GCSE Computing and I have continued to use the 
programming software on and off ever since. This was my first experience using pip, venv and Panda3d. Despite the
difficulties I had with the initial install I found each other tools to be very enjoyable to use.

Future development projects
---------------------------

I intend to continue using pip and venv to install other external libraries, as well as the dependencies for these
libraries, as this software streamlines the process and makes it much simpler to use external libraries. I will also 
take some of the uses of functions and variables into future projects such as ``def __init__(self):`` which I would like
better understand how it works so that i may make more effective and efficient use of functions and variables in the
future.
